### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/my-cool-space/my-cool-dot-space.git
   cd my-cool-dot-space
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

4. **Build CSS assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Set up Appwrite database**
   ```bash
   # Run the setup script to create required collections
   node scripts/setup-admin-settings.js
   ```

6. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # Development with auto-reload
   npm run dev

   # Production
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Application
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret

# Session debugging (for development only)
DISABLE_HTTPS=true  # Set to true if testing locally without HTTPS

# Appwrite
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id
APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=your-collection-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Discord OAuth
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-discord-client-secret
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback

# Porkbun DNS
PORKBUN_API_KEY=your-porkbun-api-key
PORKBUN_SECRET_KEY=your-porkbun-secret-key
BASE_DOMAIN=your-domain.com

# hCaptcha (Optional - for spam protection)
HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-hcaptcha-site-key
HCAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-hcaptcha-secret-key
```

### Important Notes

**Session Configuration**: The application uses session-based authentication. If you experience login issues where users are redirected back to the home page after successful Discord OAuth:

1. **For local development**: Set `DISABLE_HTTPS=true` in your `.env` file
2. **For production**: Ensure your application is served over HTTPS
3. **Session storage**: The default memory store is not suitable for production. Consider using Redis or another persistent session store.

**Discord OAuth Redirect URI**: Make sure the redirect URI in your Discord application settings exactly matches the one in your `.env` file.

### Discord OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to OAuth2 â†’ General
4. Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback` (development)
5. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Porkbun DNS Setup

1. Register your domain with Porkbun
2. Enable API access in your Porkbun account
3. Generate API keys and add them to your `.env` file

### hCaptcha Setup (Optional)

hCaptcha provides spam protection for domain requests and abuse reports:

1. Go to [hCaptcha Dashboard](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/)
2. Create a new site
3. Copy the Site Key and Secret Key to your `.env` file
4. If not configured, the system will skip captcha verification (useful for development)

**Note**: Without hCaptcha, forms are more vulnerable to automated spam and abuse.
4. Ensure your domain's nameservers are set to Porkbun's

### Appwrite Setup

1. Create an Appwrite project
2. Create a database
3. Create the following collections:
   - `subdomain-requests` - For storing subdomain requests
   - `admin_settings` - For application configuration
   - `abuse_reports` - For abuse reporting system
   - `deletion_requests` - For GDPR data deletion requests

## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Copy and edit environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Development with hot reload
npm run docker:dev

# Production deployment
npm run docker:prod
```

### Manual Docker Commands

```bash
# Build image
npm run docker:build

# Run container
npm run docker:run
```

## Admin Features

1. Log in with Discord OAuth
2. Use Appwrite console to add the "admin" label to your user
3. Access admin panel at `/admin`

npm run build      # Build CSS assets
npm run build:watch # Build CSS with file watching
npm run build:prod # Build minified CSS for production
npm run docker:dev # Start development environment with Docker
npm run docker:prod # Start production environment with Docker
npm audit          # Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit:fix      # Automatically fix security issues
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Session/Login Problems**
If users are redirected to the home page after successful Discord OAuth:

- **Check environment variables**: Ensure `SESSION_SECRET` is set to a secure random string
- **HTTPS configuration**: For production, ensure the app is served over HTTPS. For local development, set `DISABLE_HTTPS=true`
- **Cookie domain**: Verify the domain configuration matches your deployment
- **Session store**: The default memory store doesn't persist across restarts. Use Redis for production.

**2. Discord OAuth Issues**
- **Redirect URI mismatch**: Ensure the redirect URI in your Discord app settings exactly matches your `.env` configuration
- **Client credentials**: Verify `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` are correct
- **Scopes**: The application requires `identify` and `email` scopes

**3. DNS/Subdomain Creation Failures**
- **Porkbun API credentials**: Verify your API key and secret are correct and have the necessary permissions
- **Domain configuration**: Ensure your domain's nameservers are set to Porkbun's servers
- **Rate limiting**: Check if you're hitting Porkbun's API rate limits

**4. Database Connection Issues**
- **Appwrite configuration**: Verify all Appwrite environment variables are correct
- **Collection setup**: Ensure all required collections exist in your Appwrite database
- **API key permissions**: Verify your Appwrite API key has the necessary permissions

### Debug Mode

To enable additional debugging output, you can check the server logs for detailed session and authentication information.

**Development Debug Routes** (only available when `NODE_ENV != production`):
- `GET /debug/session` - View current session information and debugging data
- `GET /debug/reset-session` - Emergency session reset (clears current session)

### Session Persistence in Production

**Important**: The default MemoryStore session configuration is not suitable for production as it will leak memory and not scale past a single process. For production deployments, consider using a persistent session store like Redis:

```bash
npm install connect-redis redis
```

Then modify the session configuration in `app.js` to use Redis instead of the default memory store.
