## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in my-cool-dot-space, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report
'
2. **Use our dedicated security repository**: [my-cool-space/security-reports](https://github.com/my-cool-space/security-reports)
3. Create a **private security advisory** or **confidential issue** with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)
   - Your preferred contact method for follow-up

### Alternative Reporting Methods

- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Email**: Contact our security team directly (if email is provided in the security repository)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt within 7 days
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and assess the severity within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 7 days, others within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing
- **Recognition**: Security researchers will be credited (with permission) in our acknowledgments

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Discord OAuth 2.0**: Secure user authentication through Discord
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable secrets
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection
- **Redirect URI Validation**: Strict validation of OAuth redirect URIs to prevent open redirects

### Data Protection

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **API Key Security**: Porkbun and Appwrite API keys properly secured
- **Database Security**: Appwrite Cloud with built-in security features
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### Infrastructure Security

- **Docker Security**: 
  - Non-root user execution
  - Minimal Alpine Linux base image
  - Security updates applied during build
  - Proper signal handling with dumb-init
  - Health checks for service monitoring

- **Network Security**:
  - HTTPS enforcement
  - Secure headers with Helmet.js
  - CORS configuration
  - Secure cookie settings

### Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: `npm audit` is run regularly
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary packages are included
- **Production Dependencies**: Separate dev and production dependencies

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit sensitive data**: Use `.env` files and `.gitignore`
2. **Use environment variables**: For all configuration and secrets
3. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate user inputs
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regular security updates
5. **Follow secure coding practices**: Input validation, output encoding, etc.

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
2. **Secure environment variables**: Use secure secret management and validate all required variables are set
3. **OAuth Configuration**: Ensure production redirect URIs are properly configured (avoid localhost fallbacks)
4. **Regular backups**: Backup configuration and data
5. **Monitor logs**: Set up proper logging and monitoring
6. **Network isolation**: Use firewalls and network segmentation

### For Users

1. **Keep Discord account secure**: Use 2FA on Discord
2. **Use strong passwords**: For any accounts related to the service
3. **Report suspicious activity**: Contact us if you notice anything unusual
4. **Verify subdomain ownership**: Only request subdomains you own/control

## Common Security Considerations

### Subdomain Security

- **DNS Security**: Proper DNS configuration to prevent takeover
- **Certificate Management**: SSL certificates for subdomains
- **Abuse Prevention**: Monitoring and reporting system for abuse
- **Content Policy**: Clear guidelines for acceptable use

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
- **Authentication**: Secure API access with proper credentials
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage

### Session Security

- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly and Secure flags
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic session timeout
- **Session Regeneration**: New session IDs after authentication
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users if necessary
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures

## Security Contacts

For security-related inquiries:
- **Primary**: Use our dedicated security repository at [my-cool-space/security-reports](https://github.com/my-cool-space/security-reports)
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Create a private security advisory on this repository
- **Non-sensitive matters**: Create an issue with the `security` label in the security repository

**Note**: This is a closed-source project. Security reports should be made through the dedicated security repository to ensure proper handling and confidentiality.

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10 security recommendations
